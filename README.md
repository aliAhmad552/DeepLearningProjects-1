# Potato Disease Classification

This project is a **Potato Disease Classification System** using deep learning. It includes a machine learning model trained to classify potato diseases, an API built with FastAPI, and a React.js frontend for user interaction.

## Features
```
- Deep Learning Model: Trained using TensorFlow/Keras for potato disease classification.
- FastAPI Backend: API to serve model predictions.
- React Frontend: Web application for user interaction and image uploads.
```

## Setup Instructions
```
1. Clone the Repository
```
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name/potato-disease-classification.git
cd potato-disease-classification
```
```
2. Backend Setup (FastAPI)
```
```sh
cd api
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```sh
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
```
3. Frontend Setup (React)
```
```sh
cd frontend
npm install
```
```sh
npm start
```

## Usage
```
1. Start the FastAPI backend.
2. Start the React frontend.
3. Upload an image of a potato leaf to classify the disease.
4. View the classification result on the UI.
```

## Model Training
```
To train or retrain the model, open `training/training.ipynb` and execute the notebook step by step.
```

## Technologies Used
```
- TensorFlow/Keras: For deep learning model training
- FastAPI: Backend API for model inference
- React.js: Frontend for user interaction
- Uvicorn: ASGI server for FastAPI
```
